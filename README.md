# Howto

1. Check out [Noise 0.2](https://github.com/DLR-SR/Noise/releases/tag/v0.2.0)
2. Load Noise version 0.2
3. Clone or download this repository to your computer
4. Load the Modelica package NoiseSimulationsProcessing into Dymola
5. Run NoiseSimulationsProcessing.Batches.NoiseContinuousTimePerformance to execute all simulations
6. Copy the simulation results from the working directory to linden2015effects/2_Plots/Data
   * Note: these files are also available in the repository
7. Run 2_Plots/GeneratePlots.m to generate the plots used in the paper.
8. The plots can be found in 2_Plots/Figures
   * Note: these files are also available in the repository
